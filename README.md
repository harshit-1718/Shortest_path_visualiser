Implemented Dijkstraâ€™s and A* Search Algorithm in Python to find the shortest path between two cells in a grid and visualized their workflow using Pygame.

Run the main.py and left click on any two cells between which you want to find the shortest distance. Create obstacles by left-clicking on any of the cells.Left-click on the cell to undo your operation.Press space whenever you want the algorithm to run. Press 'c' to clear the screen.
